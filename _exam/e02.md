Note that the exact coverage of each of these exams varies quite a bit, since the pace of topics, and placement of exams during the quarter can vary considerably.  You are encouraged to look at all of them as examples of the types of questions you might be asked, but
match them against the topics we have covered, vs. the ones we have not covered.

# Review of one important topic: four ways to (handle sorting, handle `ActionListener`'s)

This is not a complete treatment, but a reminder of something you need to know.

The material comes from a combination of Chapters 12,13 (for ActionListener), and from Chapter 16 (for sorting), plus
the notes and examples from Lecture.

If you want to define some behavior for a Swing widget, i.e. something that happens when you click a button, the usual way to do that is to use `addActionListener` to indicate an object of a class that implements the ActionListener interface.

We discussed four ways to do that, each of which has pros and cons:

* Make the class that implements the button itself (i.e. a class that extends JButton) be its own ActionListener.  
* Make an inner class inside that JButton class. (Or, "one or more inner classes" if you have various buttons on, for example, a JPanel.)
* Make an anonyous class that implements ActionListener
* Use a lambda expression

There are many more details that you should have gotten from both lecture and from the textbook reading about the four items above.
