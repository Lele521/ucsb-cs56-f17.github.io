# Clairifications and Hints

Question 1: You have a choice: you can design for an unlimited number of Cabins per Aircraft, or 
you can set a maximum (e.g. 4, or 10).   

If you DO choose to set a maximum, that MUST be declared as a
constant, and the actual number should appear in only one place in your code.   Do that in whatever
way is appropriate in Java.
