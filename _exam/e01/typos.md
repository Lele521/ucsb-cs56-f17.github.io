<b>Question 4</b>: Please assume that a method `public String getName()` has been added to the `Dog` class you've been given.

<b>WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED</b>

* Please STAY where you are.   
* Write your name/seat/umail at top of p.1,3 and 5.
* Show a "thumbs up" sign (&#x1f44d;) to let us know you are done.
* We'll dismiss folks at 20 minute intervals, to reduce noise and distractions.

<b>Those who are finished</b>
* We'll allow folks to climb over others at 10:15am.
* Thanks for being patient until then.
* We'll then do another instance of that at 10:25am.
