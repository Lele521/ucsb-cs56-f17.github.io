## When you are finished... stay at your seat 

* Please hold up your pink sheet with one hand, and give us the "thumbs up" sign with the other.  
* Every 10-15 minutes we'll invite students to come forward.
* This minimizes disruption to other students.
* In the meantime, check that you:
   * Put your name, umail, seat number on p.1,3,5
   * Put your name on your pink sheet and your notes sheet.
   * Be prepared to hand in everything.
