# Typo corrections for {{site.qtr}} exam {{page.num}}

## On handout "A", p. 1, (blue sheet)

The descriptions of `compare` and `compareTo` are reversed from what they should be.  That is:

*    The description given for `compare` is actually the description for `compareTo`
*    The description given for `compareTo` is actually the description for `compare`

## In Question 4:
The *whole method*, not just the function prototype.

## In questions 7,8,9

Where you see `Comparator<ArrayList>`, CROSS IT OUT.

Write `Comparator<Student>` instead.


# Minor typos
* In question 9, there are *three* things in the list of things to notice, not two.
