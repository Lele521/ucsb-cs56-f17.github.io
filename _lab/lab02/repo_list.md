This is the list of available repos for [M16 lab02](/lab/lab02).

Please check this list for your assignment to a repo.   If you do not yet have an assignment, 
contact your mentor, or a TA or instructor to be assigned to a repo.

Staff: Put the githubid of the assigned pair.   Use alphabetical order to determine which one is githubid1, githubid2.  Before assigning
a "trio" or a "solo", check in with the instructor for approval.

The mentors listed are the ones that originally curated the repo, but we may adjust those assignments to balance the student/mentor
ratio.
