# Proposing a new legacy code project

Nearly all of the legacy code projects in the <https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects> organization started as "greenfield code" projects
written by CS56 students.   

In order to keep the pool of legacy code projects fresh, we need to allow a limited number of new greenfield projects each year.

We want to be sure that new projects meet a very high standard.  Note that this standard is considerably higher than the standard that was
used for the original pool of legacy code projects&mdash;that's deliberate. We want the pool of projects to constantly be improving in quality.

Here are the current standards that a proposal for new legacy code project must meet:

* It should propose a product that real people will actually want to use.  
   * If it is a game, it should be a game that people will really want to play.
   * If it is a tool, it shoudl be a tool that solves a real problem.
   * It does not necessarily have to be *innovative*&mdash;it can duplicate a game or tool that already exists, but it must be *useful*.
   
* If any existing code is used as a starting point, that code must be unencumbered open source with a clear open source license.

* There should be a list of user stories stated in the form: "As a (role) I can (do some thing) so that (some goal is acheived)".
