THIS LAB COUNTS TOWARD THE PROJECT POINTS PORTION OF YOUR GRADE, NOT THE LAB PORTION.

That is, it counts towards the final 500 points of the 1000 point needed before the end of the course.

Those points are recorded in Gauchospace under proj3 and proj4, each of which is out of 250 points.

You should complete at least 500 points additional points towards proj3 and proj4 by the time of the due date listed for {{page.num}}.

# Making a plan

Make a plan with your mentor for exactly which issues you are going to work on, and how you will get to your 1000 points. USE PIAZZA FOR THIS.  Send a private message on Piazza that includes your pair partner, and the word "Instructors", and the label "Project".  In the title, put "Plan for lab07".  In the plan, indicate which issues you are working on.  Include a link to each of the issues.  List the points they are estimated for, and what the total points earned would be if you completed all of those.

Then, ask your mentor to reply with feedback on your plan.

As long as you get your plan in by noon Wednesday, you should expect to get feedback by noon Thursday.  Please get your plan in earlier if possible.

If you do not get feedback by Thursday, please follow up with another post.  The instructor and TAs will monitor this to hold the mentors accountable.  Note that if you do not get your plan in by noon Wednesday, we cannot guarantee any particular response time.  We'll try to respond within 24 hours, but cannot promise that.  So please get your plan in on time.

If the TA has feedback that your plan may need to be modified, please follow up with timely correspondence to resolve the issues, and please SHOW UP IN PERSON (both of you, or all three of you if in a pair) in lab on Friday to review and discuss your plan.

# Completing issues

When you complete issues, you make a pull request back to the
github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects verison of your repo, and you make a
comment in the pull request: `fixes issue #5` (for example).  The
mention of the issue by number, using the `#` symbol, should turn into
into an automatic link to the issue.

You should resolve as many issues as you can by due date for this lab
(see the calendar). Your goal should be to get as much done as
possible by then. Then, check in with your mentor and see what work is
left, and how much more you may need to accomplish to earn the 1000
points you need to complete this part of the course.
