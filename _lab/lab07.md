THIS LAB COUNTS TOWARD THE PROJECT POINTS PORTION OF YOUR GRADE, NOT THE LAB PORTION.

That is, it counts towards the final 500 points of the 1000 point needed before the end of the course.

Those points are recorded in Gauchospace under proj3 and proj4, each of which is out of 250 points.

You should complete at least 500 points additional points towards proj3 and proj4 by the time of the due date listed for {{page.num}}.

# Completing issues

When you complete issues, you make a pull request back to the
github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects verison of your repo, and you make a
comment in the pull request: `fixes issue #5` (for example).  The
mention of the issue by number, using the `#` symbol, should turn into
into an automatic link to the issue.

You should resolve as many issues as you can by due date for this lab
(see the calendar). Your goal should be to get as much done as
possible by then. Then, check in with your mentor and see what work is
left, and how much more you may need to accomplish to earn the 1000
points you need to complete this part of the course.
