THERE IS NOTHING TO SUBMIT FOR THIS LAB.

However, you SHOULD be here in person to consult with your mentor about your progress on your legacy code labs:

* [lab05](/lab/lab05/)
* [lab07](/lab/lab07/)

Check in with your mentor, and be sure that you, pair partner, and your mentor have a DOCUMENTED PLAN in your FEEDBACK repo for how you are going to get to your final 1000 points.

Be sure that you and your mentor are on the same page about what work qualified for your first 500 points.  The TAs are starting TONIGHT to go through and record grades for that.

# OPTIONAL: Webapps

If you like, we have some material&mdash;not necessarily comprehensive or polished&dash;on constructing Java web apps using:

* SparkJava
* Heroku
* MongoDB (a NoSQL database) hosted on mlab.com
* Corgis datasets from Virginia Tech.

You can find information about these topics at the links below.

I had hoped that we would have a a required structured lab on these topics, but with the Thanksgiving break, we have simply run out of time.     However, if you are interested, you are free to explore these.

I will lecture on this topic on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving break for anyone that is interested.  That material is being provided only for your interest, and will not be on the final exam.

# SparkJava

# Heroku

# MongoDB

# Incorporating Corgis data into a SparkJava/MongoDB webapp.
