Step 0: Getting oriented
========================

Chances are you are already familiar with all of the following because you already took CS courses that used this stuff (i.e. CS8, CS16, CS24, CS32).

If not--if for example, you are a transfer student and this is your first CS course using the CSIL Lab resources, please let your TA know and he/she will help you find resources to come up to speed on these things. Or, your TA can assign you a pair partner that knows this stuff and doesn't mind helping you come up to speed.

-   knowing your College of Engineering/CSIL computer account username/password--and having an active working account.
-   knowing how to login to the systems in Phelps 3525 and the CSIL lab, and bring up both a web browser, and a terminal window.
-   knowing that "CSIL" is both a server you can log into, as well as a physical room full of computers--and knowing where to find that physical room, and what hours it is open.
-   knowing how to use a **basic text editor such as emacs or vim** to edit files on the Linux systems in Phelps 3525 and CSIL.
-   knowing basic Unix/Linux commands to create directories, change directory, manipulate files, etc., e.g. mkdir, cd, pwd, mv, rm, ls.

The rest of these instruction will assume you know all of the above. If not, then let your TA know, and we'll point you to resources where you can come up to speed.

<b>If you need help with one or more of the items in the list above</b>: here is one suggestion--the lab00 from Conrad's CS16 course. Just ignore the stuff about C programming, and pay attention to everything else:

<http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~pconrad/cs16/10S/labs/lab00>

</div>

As a separate item, you should also know how to connect to CSIL from your own computer (PC/Mac/Linux)

-   Windows: Putty, optionally with XMing. See for example: [CSIL Access:Windows](https://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/56wiki/index.php/CSIL_Access:Windows).
-   Mac/Linux: `ssh` `-Y` `username@csil.cs.ucsb.edu`, [CSIL Access:Mac and Linux](https://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/56wiki/index.php/CSIL_Access:Mac_and_Linux).

But, you don't need that for today's lab---so let's continue.

The rest of the lab: Step-by-Step
=================================


Here is an overview of the remaining steps in the lab:

1. If you didn't already do it:
    - Create a github.com account
    - Fill out the form at <http://bit.ly/cs56-m16-survey>
    - Join the UCSB-CS56-M16 organization by visiting <https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-M16/>
2. Create a *private* repo for lab00 under the UCSB-CS56-M16 organization
    - It should be called lab00_yourgithubid
    - Add a .gitignore for Java and a README.md file
    - detailed instructions [here](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/github_com_create_private_repo_under_org/)
3.  Configure your CSIL account for git
    - detailed instructions [here](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/csil_git_configuration/)
4.  Review a few basic facts about git, github.com and github.ucsb.edu
    - detailed information [here](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/git_overview/)
5.  Clone your lab00_yourgithubid repo into your CSIL account.
    - If you know how to do that, great.
    - If not, there are detailed instructions [here](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/git_cloning_your_first_repo/)
6.  Fork the cs56_rational_example into your own github.com account.  Here's how:
    - Go to the page <https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-M16/cs56-rational-example>
    - Click the "fork" button at the top right of the page
    - If asked where to fork it, choose your own github.com account
    - Congratulations: you now have a forked copy of the cs56-rational-example
    - What do you do with it? Read on...
7.  Clone the cs56_rational_example repo that you forked to your cs56 account (or your
    personal computer).
    - You can review the [cloning your first repo](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/git_cloning_your_first_repo/) tutorial if you need a reminder as to how to do this.
8.  Work through the eight examples shown, as explained in lecture, to review some basics:
    - `java`, `javac`, `ant`
    - `build.xml` files
    - JUnit testing
9.  You are now ready to work on your own lab.
    - Copy the files from the ex08 subdirectory into the top level directory of
      your own lab00 repo.
    - This means all of the files, including the directories.  You may need `cp -r` for the directories.  If you need a refresher on unix commands, ask a mentor, TA, or instructor for help.
    - Commit an initial version of those files.
    - For that, you'll need the basic git workflow, explained [here](git_basic_workflow)
    - Once you have an initial version of the files, you are ready to start work.
10. Follow the detailed instructions below to complete the assignment.
    - Refer to the README file at the root of the [cs56-rational-example repo](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-M16/cs56-rational-example/blob/master/README.md)
    - Refer to the README files inside each of the ex** directories in the repo
11. When you are finished, to "submit", there will be a link on Gauchospace for you to enter
    the URL of your repo, and the URL of your javadoc.    If you cannot find that link,
    ask your instructor on Piazza.
    
Come back to this page for updates; we may add some information about testing,
and a grading rubric that you can check your lab against before you submit.
