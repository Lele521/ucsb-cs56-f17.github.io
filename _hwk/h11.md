Part of this homework concerns the parser which was livecoded in class, which is available online here: [https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-M16/cs56-livecoded-parser](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-M16/cs56-livecoded-parser).

The rest concerns <span data-hfdp="3">HFDP Chapter 3</span> and
<span data-hfdp="4">HFDP Chapter 4</span>.  Please read those chapters, 
then answer these questions.


<ol>

{% include hwk_li_name_10pts.html %}

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;">
(12 pts) The code in the box below does not use <tt>final</tt>.  Circle variable definitions which could be marked with <tt>final</tt>.

<div style="width: 30em; float:bottom; border: 1px solid black;" markdown="1">
```java
public class Foo {
  public boolean b;
  public Foo(boolean b) {
    this.b = b;
  }
  public static void bar(boolean b) {
    Foo f = new Foo(b);
    f.b = !b;
  }
}
```
</div>

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;"> (8 pts) TBD (live coded parser question)

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:5em;">

In Chapter 3, the Open/Closed principle is presented in the context of
the Decorator pattern.  
<ol>
<li> (10 pts) Fill in the two blanks to result in the
statement of this principle.

<p style="margin-top:3em; font-size: 120%;">
Open for _______________________  closed for ___________________.
</p>
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;">(10 pts) Ok, that was the easy part; you just had to find the words in the chapter.  Now, the harder part: explain what this means in your own words.  "In your own words" means, don't just write down words for the book.   Read the book, then put the book down, and write what you've learned as if you were explaining it to someone.

</li>
</ol>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:1em;"> The decorator pattern features both
composition and inheritance. 

<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom:8em;"> (10 pts) How is composition used in the Decorator pattern?

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;"> (10 pts) How is inheritance used in
the Decorator pattern?  (Note: there is a particular purpose for which
inheritance is used in the Decorator pattern.   The book describes this very specifically.)
</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;"> (10 pts) The standard Java library classes that
implement input and output streams use the Decorator pattern.  Describe how the Decorator pattern is used here, and what benefits it provides. 
</li>



<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) A Java constructor, invoked with `new`, and a method of a Factory object (one created using the Factory design pattern) can both be used to create instances of new objects.   What is the situation in which a Factory object is preferred to just instantiating a class with `new`?   That is, what problem does the factory design pattern solve?

</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Explain how the
Factory design pattern and the Abstract Factory design pattern are different.

</li>
