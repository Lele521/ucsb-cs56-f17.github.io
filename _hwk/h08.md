(10 pts) In your own words, how does an AST capture the idea of operator precedence?

<div style="width: 30em; float:right; padding: 1em; margin:1em: border: 1px solid black;" markdown="1">
```java
public String speak(Animal animal) {
    if (animal instanceof Dog) {
      return "Bark!";
    } else if (animal instanceof Cat) {
      return "Meow";
    } else if (animal instanceof Fish) {
      return "Blub";
    } else {
      assert(false); // should not be possible
      return "IMPOSSIBLE";
    }
  }
```

(10 pts) The phrase *code smell* is used by some software developers to refer to things in "other people's code" that suggest that the code may have some problems, and needs to be refactored.

Long sequences of if/else statements that use `instanceof` are often considered to be a so-called *code smell*.   For example, the code in the box at right.

Please give at least two reasons that this style of code is not desirable, as compared to some of the available alternatives.
