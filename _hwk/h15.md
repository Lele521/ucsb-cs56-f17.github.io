This homework pertains to Chapter 4 in HFDP.  Please read that chapter, and any reading notes
that may be online.  The reading notes for HFDP are a work in progress, but slowly, a little bit at a time,
I am adding some things there.   So check back periodically as you read, work on the homework,
and later as you prepare for the exams.
